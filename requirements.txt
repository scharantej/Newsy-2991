**Flask code analysis:**

The provided Flask code defines a web application with two routes:

1. `/`: serves the 'index.html' template.
2. `/news_articles`: fetches news articles from the News API and returns them in JSON format.
   - It makes a GET request to the News API using the 'requests' library.
   - The API key is hardcoded in the URL (replace 'API_KEY' with your actual API key).
   - The response is parsed as JSON, and the list of articles is extracted.
   - The articles are then saved to a database (this part is not implemented in the code you provided).
   - Finally, the articles are returned as a JSON response.

**Requirements.txt code:**

To generate the `requirements.txt` file for this code, you can run the following command:

```sh
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

This will create a file named `requirements.txt` in your current directory, containing the following packages:

```txt
Flask==2.1.2
itsdangerous==2.1.2
Jinja2==3.1.2
MarkupSafe==2.1.1
Werkzeug==2.1.2
requests==2.28.1
```

These packages are required for the Flask application and its dependencies to run correctly.
